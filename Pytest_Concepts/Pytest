# Pytest is python framework
# it is test engine for python/

# Every function started with test word will be treated as test in pytest
# If we name the function with test then green icon comes there

#Fixtures
1. Reusable code should be marked as fixtures and that can be reused across
different tests
2. Pre setup code should be mentioned as fixture and then pass it to test
as an argument
3. When test runs then it first checks that fixture is passed or not then only
further code executes
4. We can store fixtures in "conftest.py" file and use across different files
5. If scope="session" then fixture will run only once though multiple files are run
Though mentioned it multiple time
6. "yield" keyword separates between pre condition and post condition
7. In same fixture we can handle setup and tear down steps separated by yeild keyword
8. All package, function, classes and python files name should start with "test_"
to run as pytest framework

#Install Pytest from terminal of pycharm or command prompt
Pip install pytest

#Check version
pytest --version

#Install the Pytest plugin:
pip install pytest-playwright

#Install the required browsers:
playwright install

#To run file form terminal
Pytest file_name.py

#To run individual test from terminal
Pytest file_name.py::test_name   # do not give (arguments)
Or
-s will include print statements
Pytest file_name.py::test_name -s

#To run framework from command line
Pytest
But here the files named with test prefix will run only

#To run tagged tests from framework
pytest -m tag_name(smoke, regression etc)

#To run playwright test from terminal
Navigate to that directory by cd directory name, then
Pytest file_name::Function_name â€“headed


# Playwright assertion using "expect" keyword
# Pytest assertion using "assert" keyword

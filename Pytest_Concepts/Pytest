# Pytest is python framework
# it is test engine for python/

# Every function started with test word will be treated as test in pytest
# If we name the function with test then green icon comes there

#Fixtures
1. Reusable code should be marked as fixtures and that can be reused across
different tests
2. Pre setup code should be mentioned as fixture and then pass it to test
as an argument
3. When test runs then it first checks that fixture is passed or not then only
further code executes
4. We can store fixtures in "conftest.py" file and use across different files
5. If scope="session" then fixture will run only once though multiple files are run
Though mentioned it multiple time
6. "yield" keyword separates between pre condition and post condition
7. In same fixture we can handle setup and tear down steps separated by yeild keyword
